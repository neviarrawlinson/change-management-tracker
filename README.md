# Change Management Tracker

Change Management Tracker is a lightweight tool designed to help organizations document, assess, and approve changes to systems, processes, and infrastructure. It supports IT and business teams in maintaining oversight, ensuring compliance, and minimizing operational risk during change implementation.

This tracker is especially useful for teams operating under IT governance frameworks such as ITIL, COBIT, ISO 27001, and NIST, where structured change documentation and audit readiness are essential.
